## Introduction
In this repository it is my solutions for the assignments given in CS106A taught by Prof. Mehran Sahami.

Course description: Topics focus on the introduction to the engineering of computer applications emphasizing modern software engineering principles: object-oriented design, decomposition, encapsulation, abstraction, and testing.
Programming Methodology teaches the widely-used Java programming language along with good software engineering principles. Emphasis is on good programming style and the built-in facilities of the Java language.

PART A: HOUSE HUNTING
Determine how long it will take you to save enough money to make the down payment 

given the following assumptions: 
    1.Call the cost of your dream home total_cost . 
    2.Call the portion of the cost needed for a down payment portion_down_payment . 
        For simplicity, assume that portion_down_payment = 0.25 (25%). 
    3.Call the amount that you have saved thus far current_savings . 
        You start with a current savings of $0. 
    4.Assume that you invest your current savings wisely, with an annual return of r 
        (in other words, at the end of each month, you receive an additional 
        current_savings*r/12 funds to put into your savings â€“ the 12 is because r is an annual rate).
        Assume that your investments earn a return of r = 0.04 (4%). 
    5.Assume your annual salary is annual_salary . 
    6.Assume you are going to dedicate a certain amount of your salary each month 
        to saving for the down payment. Call that portion_saved . 
        This variable should be in decimal form (i.e. 0.1 for 10%). 
    7.At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment,
        plus a percentage of your monthly salary (annual salary / 12).
        
Calculate how many months it will take you to save up enough money for a down payment.
